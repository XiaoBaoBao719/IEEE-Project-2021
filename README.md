# Social Robots
Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, many individuals (myself included) felt quite isolated from our friends and loved ones. While it was obviously possible for individuals to interact with one another virtually due to the countless digital peripherals that we have at our disposal, it's often important for humans to have phyiscal interaction. This comes in many forms, such as pets; but there's also potential for us to interact with synthetic buddies. Enter social robots like Otto.

## What is Otto?
Otto is a small friendly social robot that was developed by Nestworks based largely on the designs and programs of BoB the Biped https://www.instructables.com/BoB-the-BiPed/. The design is entirely open-source and was therefore a good candidate for a personal project due to the wealth of documentation available.

## Building Otto
In order to construct my own version of Otto, I used the following supplies:
* Arduino Uno
* Adafruit 16-Channel PWM Servo Driver
* 4x 4k Ohm Variable Potentiometers
* 4x SG92R Tower Pro Servo Motors
* 9V DC Female Header Connector

Some of these components were common hobbyist parts that I had lying around but several of the key components, most notably the Adafruit PWM Driver, were generously provided by the UC Davis IEEE Chapter for usuage. 

Here are some of the parts up close!
